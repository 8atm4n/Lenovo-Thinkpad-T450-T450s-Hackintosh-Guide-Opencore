# Lenovo Thinkpad T450 & T450s Hackintosh Guide for Catalina with Opencore
This repo contains the installation guide and EFI files required to get a perfectly functional Catalina 10.15.7 hackintosh on your T450 or T450s since they share the same hardware. Everything is stable and functional as described in this Readme. 

## A few worthy mentions about this repo:

- **This guide is not for models with Haswell 4th gen CPU**
- **The EFI folder and the patched ACPI were first created by [EchoEspirit](https://github.com/EchoEsprit/Hackintosh-Catalina-OpenCore-Lenovo-T450s-efi) and futher optimized by [i3p9](https://github.com/i3p9/Hackintosh-Catalina-OpenCore-Lenovo-T450s-efi). I tweaked a couple of things and fixed some errors that were happening on T450 + added Intel WiFi drivers from [Openintelwireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless)**
- **I will try my best to keep the repo updated with the latest kexts and Opencore version**
- **This EFI works with Big Sur Beta 10 but compatibility with future versions is not guaranteed until i update the kexts and Opencore version that will support the latest version of Big Sur**

# Introduction

EFI folder and Guide for Thinkpad T450 and T450s Hackintosh Catalina.

- `Tested CPUs`: **i5-5200U/5300u & i7-5600u**
- `Integrated Graphics`: **HD Graphics 5500**
- `Sound Card`: **ALC292**
- `Wireless Cards Tested`: **DW1820A 00JT494/Broadcom BCM94360CSAX/Intel 7265/7260**

# Bios

- `Security -> Security Chip`: **Disabled**;
- `Memory Protection -> Execution Prevention`: **Enabled**;
- `Virtualization -> Intel Virtualization Technology`: **Enabled**;
- `Virtualization -> Vt-directed IO`: **Disabled**;
- `Internal Device Access -> Bottom Cover Tamper Detection`: must be **Disabled**;
- `Anti-Theft -> Current Setting`: **Disabled**;
- `Anti-Theft -> Computrace -> Current Setting`: **Disabled**;
- `Secure Boot -> Secure Boot`: **Disabled**;
- `UEFI/Legacy Boot`: **UEFI Only**;
- `Fingerprint Sensor`: **Disabled** `(Causes issues with wake from sleep)`;
- `CSM Support`: **Yes**.

# What works

- Sleep / Wake
- Wifi and Bluetooth (Built-in Intel 7265 or 7260 cards with Heliport + itlwm.kext) **Airportitlwm.kext is not recommended, it causes issues with Trackpad after wake from sleep {See on Post Install}**
- AirPort Extreme (Broadcom BCM94360CSAX & NGFF A/E Adapter) **Recommended Upgrade to get native WiFi & Bluetooth**
- Handoff, Continuity, AirDrop
- iMessage, FaceTime, App Store, iTunes Store (Change Config.plist -> PlatformInfo -> Generic -> MLB and SystemSerialNumber)
- Ethernet
- Onboard audio (Use alc_fix to fix unworking jack after replug )
- USB 2.0 / USB 3.0
- Dual Batteries
- Touchpad
- Trackpoint
- miniDP
- SD Card Reader (Thanks to @willmav5000)
- Use [one-key-hidpi](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi) to enable HiDPI
- If you are using a usb mouse with side buttons, you can spoof apple usb mouse by change the pid and vid in AnyAppleUSBMouse.kext/Info.plist and enable it in config.plist.

# What doesn't work

- VGA
- Sidecar (Wired Sidecar works but only in Macbook9,1 SMBIOS, which has bad battery life, you can choose what you want)
- With the IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext and itlwm.kext enabled Bluetooth headphones only work when you are not connected to any wifi network or turn off wifi. This is a known issue with 7265 and 7260 cards. You can get 8x series cards to fix this or buy the recomended cards (DW1820A 00JT494 or Broadcom BCM94360CSAX)

## Note: If you need to edit config.plist, don't use OpenCore configurator or Clover configurator, use PlistEdit pro (Included in Utilities) or Xcode.

# Installation Guide

**COMING SOON**

# Post Install
Once you have verifed that your machine boots properly without any issues as described in the "What Works section", proceed to do the following

### 1. Disable Verbose mode (the black screen with logs on boot up)
In config.plist, navigate to NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> boot-args and delete only the '-v' argument

### 2. Disable AppleDebug and ApplePanic
In the config.plist, naviaget to Misc -> Debug and change both AppleDebug and ApplePanic to False (NO)

You can also disable the boot picker screen so that you boot straight to th Apple logo by setting ShowPicker under Misc -> Boot to False (NO)

### 3. Enable native WiFi with the Intel card
You can enable native WiFi on the Intel card by navigating (in config.plist) to Kernel -> Add -> 20 and set Enabled to True/YES (Enabling Airportitlwm.kext) and in 21 set Enabled to False/NO (Disabling itlwm.kext).

**Note:**

  **1. This kext gives you native WiFi menu and enables location services, but often causes issues with the trackpad & trackpoint after waking from sleep (it doesn't work). A quick fix is to put the laptop to sleep again by closing the lid until the red sleep light starts to blink then waking the laptop again. Also it only happens when you put the laptop to sleep for a very long time (more than 2 or 3 hours). So for those who don't put their laptop to sleep for a very long time and just turn it off after use, this kext is ok to use.**
  
  **2. The kext included in this EFI is only for Catalina. For those in Big Sur you should download the corresponding Airportitlwm.kext from [Openintelwireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless) for Big Sur and replace the one in EFI -> Kexts.**
  
### 4. Add Device Properties for Serial number and other info
Follow this [guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) to set up serial number and the accompanying info to get iServices
