# What works

- Sleep / Wake
- Wifi and Bluetooth (Built-in Intel 7265 or 7260 cards with Heliport + itlwm.kext) **Airportitlwm.kext is not recommended, it causes issues with Trackpad after wake from sleep**
- AirPort Extreme (Broadcom BCM94360CSAX & NGFF A/E Adapter) **Recommended Upgrade to get native WiFi & Bluetooth**
- Handoff, Continuity, AirDrop
- iMessage, FaceTime, App Store, iTunes Store (Change Config.plist -> PlatformInfo -> Generic -> MLB and SystemSerialNumber)
- Ethernet
- Onboard audio (Use alc_fix to fix unworking jack after replug )
- USB 2.0 / USB 3.0
- Dual Batteries
- Touchpad
- Trackpoint
- miniDP
- SD Card Reader (Thanks to @willmav5000)
- Use [one-key-hidpi](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi) to enable HiDPI
- If you are using a usb mouse with side buttons, you can spoof apple usb mouse by change the pid and vid in AnyAppleUSBMouse.kext/Info.plist and enable it in config.plist.

# What doesn't work

- VGA
- Sidecar (Wired Sidecar works but only in Macbook9,1 SMBIOS, which has bad battery life, you can choose what you want)
- With the IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext and itlwm.kext enabled Bluetooth headphones only work when you are not connected to any wifi network or turn off wifi. This is a known issue with 7265 and 7260 cards. You can get 8x series cards to fix this or buy the recomended cards (DW1820A 00JT494 or Broadcom BCM94360CSAX)

## Note: If you need to edit config.plist, don't use OpenCore configurator or Clover configurator, use PlistEdit pro (Included in Utilities) or Xcode.
